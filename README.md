# FIND DECENT NAME, SO FAR: PERSONAL SOLIDITY

Personal repository containing various optimized Solidity snippets, libs, contracts...
Even if undirectly, might no matter what be inspired of [Vectorized's Solady repository](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady).

See it as a personal playground, use at your own risks, the code here have never been audited, neither expected to be deployed to production.
I won't take any responsability in case of any fund loss.
